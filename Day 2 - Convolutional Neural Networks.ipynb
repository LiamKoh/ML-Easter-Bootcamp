    "The standard neural network we looked at in the previous lesson takes in a vector as input thus a flattened image could be passed in as input and used for classification problems successfully. But this is not the best way to do it. If you think about an image, the spatial relations between the different pixels is an important piece of information when determening what the image is. If we scrambled the pixels of an image, it would be much harder to determine what is in it. This is basically what we are doing when we flatten the image and use standard NNs as the order of pixels which we use in the input vector to the network does not affect the performance of the NN. We are losing the information of the spatial relations of the pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks solve this very problem. Rather than performing a matrix multiplication, a convolution operation is performed which can take in a 2d input and give a 2d output hence keep the information about the spatial relations of the pixels. This greatly increases their performance on image and video processing tasks."
