    "\n",
    "An autoencoder is a model that con perform unsupervised machine learning. It can also be used as a generative model, as we will see.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of valuable input data is high dimensional, but \n",
    "When we see things, we don't consciously percieve the wavelength of light hitting each of our individual cells. This is the very high dimensional, raw input data that your eyes recieve, but this information is too complex for us to use for planning and decision making etc. Instead, what we do is perform abstraction from it - we build up more meaningful, general and vague descriptions of the environment.\n",
    "We percieve and would describe the scene using a few high level *features* such as: ' I see a face', 'It is smiling', 'It is nearby' rather than the millions of raw wavelengths. We somehow manage to map the high dimensional, low level wavelength data into much lower dimensional, high level concepts. The variables that we choose to represent the data in this lower dimensional space are called **latent variables**. \n",
    "We can model this function that performs abstraction by mapping the low level features into higher ones with a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lower dimensional representation is much more easily interpretable than the higher dimensional input. Once we have this lower dimensional representation of our input, we want to"
